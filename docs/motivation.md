I have always felt that I want to be someone who is constantly learning and growing. 
This however turns out to be much easier said than done.

I am committing myself to this journey of writing for the following reasons:

### Accountability

I am going to use this space to keep myself accountable - to continue to not only learn but 
to prove to myself that I am on the path. 
As a perfectionist, it is difficult to get started on anything knowing 
that it will not be perfect. However, I would rather have something out in the world even though
it is not perfect, than to not have anything at all. 

### Measure the Growth

This will also be a good way to measure how much I have grown over the years in the disciplines
that I dedicate myself to. I think someone has once said that you cannot improve what you cannot measure.
Although it sounds a bit exaggerated, I think there is a lot of truth to that statement. 

### Always Give Back 

Wherever I am at in the journey of learning and growing, I believe that there is always someone a step ahead
and also a step behind. This means that I should always stay humble but it also means that I can always give back to the community even if I feel I am not 
good enough or knowledgeable enough. There is always someone I can help. This space of writing is primarily for 
myself but if others can find it helpful I would be more than happy to be part of others who are on the 
same journey as myself.

### Teach and Learn

One of the best ways to learn something new is to teach that to someone else. Anyone who has taught anything
will know that to be able to teach, you need to learn in a way that is comprehensive. For you cannot teach something you yourself do not understand. 
Also, in the process of teaching, you not only internalize the lessons in a much deeper way, you also can discover gaps in the knowledge 
you never thought you had before trying to teach it.

### Just Have Fun

Last but not the least, there is fun and joy in learning and teaching and contributing. Nothing has to be 
necessarily for something grand. I want to always keep an open and positive mind and do my best 
to enjoy the time I have on this earth learning about cool and interesting things and be part of an amazing community of tech.
